                    <p>"I hope you will support Sol and Christine's efforts in finding treatments for Rett through a tax deductible donation for research. It is through research that we will be able to find effective treatments that will release all of these beautiful children from their disability."</p>
                    <p class="taRt">&mdash; Huda Y. Zoghbi, M.D., Rett Syndrome gene co-discoverer</p>
                    <p>"The hope for a cure for Rett Syndrome is not unreasonable because the damage to the brain appears to happen in later stages of development, after birth. Therefore, the damage could potentially be prevented by treating infant girls who are born with the genetic change. We already have genetic tests that could identify affected girls at birth. But to develop a cure we need to understand how the genetic change affects the function of the brain cells. Researchers from multiple disciplines are coming together to attack this question from different angles. Supporting their research will speed up the process and increase the chances that our dream of a cure will become a reality in our lifetime."</p>
