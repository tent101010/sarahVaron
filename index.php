               <h4><a href="video.php">Watch a CBS show on Rett Syndrome featuring Sarah.</a></h4>
            </div>
            <p>Our mission is to find the cure for Rett Syndrome.</p>
            <p>Rett Syndrome is a genetic neurological disorder that randomly strikes 1 in 10,000 girls within the first two years of life. Though Rett Syndrome may affect males, few are known to survive pregnancy. There is no cure. Our best hope is through research to understand and develop an effective therapy to find the cure.</p>
            <p>Sarah, our daughter, was born on Sunday, May 20, 2001. On Thursday, December 5, 2002, Sarah tested positive for Rett Syndrome</p>
            <p>The Sarah Varon Foundation for Rett Research's beliefs and purposes are the following:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>The belief that the cure for Rett Syndrome is within ten years</li>
               <li>To support, encourage, fund, and accelerate research for the treatment and cure for Rett Syndrome</li>
               <li>To increase public awareness of Rett syndrome</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Thank you for your help in finding the cure for Rett Syndrome.</p>
            <p class="deepIndent">Christine and Sol Varon</p>
