               <p>May 29, 2008 - Until now, scientists thought that the gene behind Rett syndrome was an "off" switch for other genes. But the new study, published today in Science, shows that it is an "on" switch for a startlingly vast number of genes.</p>
               <p>March 10, 2008 - Researchers at Perth's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research have found that girls and young women with Rett syndrome are nearly four times more likely to suffer a fracture.</p>
               <p>July 2007 - International Rett Syndrome Association and Rett Syndrome Research Foundation merge to create the <a href="http://www.rettsyndrome.org">International Rett Syndrome Foundation</a> (IRSF).</p>
               <p>February 8, 2007 - The symptoms of Rett Syndrome were reversed in a genetic mouse model study by Adrian Bird, Ph.D., of the University of Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>2006 - Duplication of MECP2 gene also leads to neurological and cognitive problems in boys. Possible link to role of anxiety in behavior patters. </p>
               <p>2005 - MECP2's protein relationships to other genes being established.</p>
               <p>2005 - Nearby gene, STK9, mimics Rett in onset, giving opportunities for diagnoses, clarification of biochemical pathways. MECP2'S protein relationships to other genes established.</p>
               <p>2004 - MECP2 protein variant specific to neurons identified</p>
               <p>March 8, 2004 - New studies show Rett-like symptoms circumvented in mice.</p>
               <p>October 30, 2003 - RSRF-funded study leads to breakthrough for Rett Syndrome research.
               <p>October 24, 2003 - <a href="http://www.rettsyndrome.org/content.asp?contentid=476" target="_blank">IRSA</a> (International Rett Syndrome Association) recently elected Sol Varon to the board of directors.</p>
               <p>October 23, 2003 - The CBS affiliate in Sacramento, CA produced and televised a video short, <a href="video.php">Rett Syndrome: A Family's Fight For A Cure</a>, featuring Sarah. This will be sent to all CBS affiliates for televised showing.</p>
