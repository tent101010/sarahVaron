                  <h3>How to Make a Tax-Deductible Donation to Find a Cure</h3>
                  <p class="quote">"Our single purpose is to find a cure for Rett Syndrome, which may be the Rosetta Stone for many other neurological conditions. In speaking with Dr. Uta Francke, Dr. Huba Zoghbi, and Dr. Alan Percy along with Kathy Hunter, Founder, IRSA, and Monica Coenraads, Founder, RSRF, the belief and hope is that a cure for Rett Syndrome will be found. For us, as the parents of Sarah, it is the day-to-day faith that we can make a difference, even by cutting the time down by a day, which drives us. Until then, IRSA and the research doctors will receive our support. Please ask your friends to help these courageous doctors find the cure by making a tax-deductible donation to the association of their choice."</p>
